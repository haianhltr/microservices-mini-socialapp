# Microservices Mini Social App

## Project Overview

Welcome to our Microservices Mini Social App! This project serves as a hands-on playground for exploring and understanding the microservices architecture. The primary focus is to simulate a simple social media platform where users can create blog posts and interact through comments.

### Key Objectives

- **Experiencing Microservices Architecture:** The core aim is to gain practical insights into the workings of microservices, understanding how different services interact and operate as part of a larger system.
- **Building Functionalities:** This includes creating blog posts and enabling user comments, showcasing how separate services can effectively manage different functionalities.

## Architecture

The application is designed with a clear separation of concerns, following the microservices architecture principles. Each aspect of the app is handled by a dedicated service:

- **Posts Service:** Manages all functionalities related to blog posts, including creation, storage, and retrieval.
- **Comments Service:** Exclusively handles everything about comments, from posting to linking them with the relevant blog posts.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** The user interface is built using React, offering a dynamic and responsive experience.
- **Backend Services:** Both the Posts and Comments services are built using Express.js, providing a robust and scalable server-side solution.

## Usage and Setup

[Provide instructions on how to set up and run the project locally, including environment setup, installing dependencies, and steps to get the server and frontend running.]

## Important Note

This project is designed as an educational tool for understanding microservices architecture and should not be used as a direct template for future microservices projects. It's a basic implementation intended for learning and experimentation purposes.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas on how to improve this application or extend its functionalities, feel free to fork this repository and submit your pull requests.
